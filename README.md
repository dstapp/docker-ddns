This package allows you to set up a dynamic DNS server that allows you to connect to
devices at home from anywhere in the world. All you need is a cheap VPS, a domain and access to it's nameserver.

## Installation

You can either take the image from DockerHub or build it on your own.

### Using DockerHub

Just customize this to your needs and run:

```
docker run -it -d \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -p 53:53 \
    -p 53:53/udp \
    -e SHARED_SECRET=changeme \
    -e ZONE=example.org \
    -e RECORD_TTL=3600 \
    --name=dyndns \
    davd/docker-ddns:latest
```

If you want to persist DNS configuration across container recreation, add `-v /somefolder:/var/cache/bind`. If you are experiencing any 
issues updating DNS configuration using the API (`NOTAUTH` and `SERVFAIL`), make sure to add writing permissions for root (UID=0) to your 
persistent storage (e.g. `chmod -R a+w /somefolder`).

You can also use Compose / Swarm to set up this project. For more information and an example `docker-compose.yml` with persistent data 
storage, please refer to this file: https://github.com/dprandzioch/docker-ddns/blob/master/docker-compose.yml

### Build from source / GitHub

```
git clone https://github.com/dprandzioch/docker-ddns
git checkout master # Make sure to build the latest stable release
cd docker-ddns
$EDITOR envfile
make deploy
```

Make sure to change all environment variables in `envfile` to match your needs. Some more information can be found here: 
https://www.davd.io/build-your-own-dynamic-dns-in-5-minutes/

## Exposed ports

Afterwards you have a running docker container that exposes three ports:

* 53/TCP    -> DNS
* 53/UDP    -> DNS
* 8080/TCP  -> Management REST API


## Using the API

That package features a simple REST API written in Go, that provides a simple
interface, that almost any router that supports Custom DDNS providers can
attach to (e.g. Fritz!Box). It is highly recommended to put a reverse proxy
before the API.

It provides one single GET request, that is used as follows:

http://myhost.mydomain.tld:8080/update?secret=changeme&domain=foo&addr=1.2.3.4

### Fields

* `secret`: The shared secret set in `envfile`
* `domain`: The subdomain to your configured domain, in this example it would
   result in `foo.example.org`. Could also be multiple domains that should be
   redirected to the same domain separated by comma, so "foo,bar"
* `addr`: IPv4 or IPv6 address of the name record


For the DynDNS compatible fields please see Dyn's documentation here: 

```
https://help.dyn.com/remote-access-api/perform-update/
```


### DynDNS compatible API

This package contains a DynDNS compatible handler for convenience and for use cases
where clients cannot be modified to use the JSON responses and/or URL scheme outlined
above.

This has been tested with a number of routers. Just point the router to your DDNS domain
for updates.

The handlers will listen on:
* /nic/update
* /v2/update
* /v3/update


**The username is not validated at all so you can use anything as a username**
**Password is the shared secret provided as an ENV variable**

#### Examples

An example on the ddclient (Linux DDNS client) based Ubiquiti router line:

```
set service dns dynamic interface eth0 service dyndns host-name <your-ddns-hostname-to-be-updated>
set service dns dynamic interface eth0 service dyndns login <anything-as-username-is-not-validated>
set service dns dynamic interface eth0 service dyndns password <shared-secret>
set service dns dynamic interface eth0 service dyndns protocol dyndns2
set service dns dynamic interface eth0 service dyndns server <your-ddns-server>
```

Optional if you used this behind an HTTPS reverse proxy like I do:

```
set service dns dynamic interface eth0 service dyndns options ssl=true
```

This also means that DDCLIENT works out of the box and Linux based devices should work.

D-Link DIR-842:

Another router that has been tested is from the D-Link router line where you need to fill the 
details in on the Web Interface. The values are self-explanatory. Under the server (once you chosen Manual)
you need to enter you DDNS server's hostname or IP. The protocol used by the router will be the 
dyndns2 by default and cannot be changed.


## Accessing the REST API log

Just run

```
docker logs -f dyndns
```

## DNS setup

To provide a little help... To your "real" domain, like `domain.tld`, you
should add a subdomain that is delegated to this DDNS server like this:

```
dyndns                   IN NS      ns
ns                       IN A       <put ipv4 of dns server here>
ns                       IN AAAA    <optional, put ipv6 of dns server here>
```

Your management API should then also be accessible through

```
http://ns.domain.tld:8080/update?...
```

If you provide `foo` as a domain when using the REST API, the resulting domain
will then be `foo.dyndns.domain.tld`.

## Common pitfalls

* If you're on a systemd-based distribution, the process `systemd-resolved` might occupy the DNS port 53. Therefore starting the container might fail. To fix this disable the DNSStubListener by adding `DNSStubListener=no` to `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` and restart the service using `sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service` but be aware of the implications...
